### Hello there 👋  

#### A Cloud & DevOps Enthusiast in transition ☁️  

I’m Syafiq, a part-time ICT student at [SUSS](https://www.suss.edu.sg) with a minor in ☁️ Cloud Computing.  
Coming from a non-IT background, I’m currently transitioning into the tech industry with a strong focus on **Cloud Engineering and DevOps**.  

I’m AWS Certified (Cloud Practitioner & Solutions Architect Associate) and actively working on projects to build hands-on experience in **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **automation**, and **DevOps practices**. My next milestones include the **Terraform Associate**, **RHCSA**, and **SysOps Administrator Associate** certifications.  

I’m looking for opportunities where I can contribute, learn from experienced professionals, and grow as a Cloud/DevOps Engineer.
